            I'm gonna be completely honest with you, I sat down to do the <strong>40 page</strong> reading last night and got <small>20 pages</small> in before I realized I had no idea what I was reading about and also that I really didnt care. I told myself I was gonna come back to it and finish reading so I could write my <time>response</time> but <sup>unfortunately</sup> I had one more reading response skip left to use and I never did come back to it because the 20 pages I had read were so <button>jarringly</button> boring that I could not bring myself to bare the idea that I was literally only halfway done. I couldnt even remember what i was reading about in the first place. Did you find this reading <b>excruciating?</b>

            I find myself wanting to blame my <i>ADHD</i> for not being able to soak up the ,<i>readings</i> we have some <time>times</time> but it's like no .. this is like not about focus this is just like sooo boring... And specifically to <code>Bardini</code>, <span>sibling</span>, what the hell are you talking about lmao
