im still trying to grasp how much/little we can do with JavaScript, so that would be interesting to explore, as well as understanding a bit more the formulaic setup of how jss works so i can take more creative libereties if thats even possible, as for assignment 9 i had trouble understanding exactly what each line was doing i just kind of remembered what we had done in class + googled.
