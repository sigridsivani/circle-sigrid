            <span class="font2">The Court is made up of towering, exquisite palaces, full of roaring hearths and is bedecked in evergreens. Carved sleighs are the court's preferred method of transport, hauled by velvet-antlered reindeer whose splayed hooves are ideal for ice and snow.

            The Winter Court's forces are well trained, but they often rely on the great, white bears that stalk the realm for any unwanted visitors. The army includes these white bears, which wore armor during times of war, and used white foxes as couriers, the foxes carrying messages strapped to their embroidered vests.

                The High Fae of the Winter Court have hair that is snow-white or as dark as the blackest night, skin ranging from moon pale to rich brown. They tend to wear fur-lined clothing. Their court has many species of Lesser Fae. One looks like long-limbed creatures that are shards of ice given form, tall enough they could place banners atop war tents.
