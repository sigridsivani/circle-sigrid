            <span class="font2">The High Lord of the Day Court, Helion Spell-Cleaver, is a dark-skinned man clothed in white and gold colors. He is also Lucien Vanserra's biological father from an affair he had with the Lady of the Autumn Court hundreds of years before the start of A Court of Thorns and Roses.

            In A Court of Mist and Fury, Rhysand tells Feyre that the Day Court had a thousand libraries that were personally looted by Amarantha, and that the Day Court has been responsible for archiving Prythian's knowledge of magic for centuries. The Day Court is known for its immense basin of knowledge and its people for their gift of inventing.
