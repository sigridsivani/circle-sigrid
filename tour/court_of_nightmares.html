            <span class="font2">There are avenues, separate buildings with spires, homes, and bridges. It is an entire metropolis carved from the dark stone of the mountain itself. Every surface is carved with lovely, hideous artwork: figures dance and fornicate, beg and revel, pillars are carved to look like curling vines of night-blooming flowers.

            Its inhabitants do not agree that Rhysand is their High Lord since he is not completely a High Fae being half-Illyrian, whom the inhabitants of the city consider Lesser Faeries. Rhysand gave the Hewn City to those who hated him, but not enough to be stupid and have since tolerated his rule, especially when it so rarely interferes with their lives.

                Traditionally, the Hewn City was the home of the High Lord of the Night Court and the place from which he governs his territory. However, in the case of Rhysand, he vastly prefers Velaris and the Court of Dreams. Rhysand has assigned Morrigan to be in charge of Hewn City, but the inhabitants of the Hewn City are ruled primarily by Keir, who serves as a Steward for Rhysand, making the Court of Nightmares a haven for all those who oppose Rhysand's practices or philosophies and preferring instead the ancestral values of the treacherous Night Court. They're happy to stay in the Hewn City, rarely leaving, ruling themselves, and being as wicked as they please, for all eternity.
