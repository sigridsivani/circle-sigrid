        <p class="autumncourt-text"> <span class="special-font"> Like all Courts, the Autumn Court is ruled by a High Lord, Beron Vanserra. Beron and his wife originally had seven sons: Lucien, Eris, and five other unnamed sons. Lucien was really the son of the High Lord of the Day Court, Helion, but was raised as one of Beron's sons.

            <span class="font2">The Autumn Court is one of the seven courts of Prythian, and a Seasonal Court. It is known to be beautiful, cutthroat, and highly competitive, a court of foxes. The High Lord of Autumn, Beron Vanserra, is gifted with the power of fire and is known to be the oldest and the cruelest of all the High Lords. He rules the Autumn Court with his wife the Lady of the Autumn Court and his living sons.

            The woods of the Autumn Court look like a jewelry box, a latticework of red, gold, brown, and green. The colors are so vivid that it's hard not to gawk and gape. Surrounding the forests of the Autumn Court are farmlands and fields, inhabited by the Lesser Faeries who work the land. It is a land of fertile valleys and jade streams that end in steep foothills that leaped into gray, snowcapped mountains mark the start of the shared range with the Winter Court to the north.

                Inhabitants of the Autumn Court tend to have hair of varying shades of red, brown or gold eyesâ€”sometimes green, and pale skin.
