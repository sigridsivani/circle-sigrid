            <span class="font2">Under the Mountain is the name of Amarantha's infernal court and place of rule, from which she ruled all of Prythian.

            Under the Mountain's entrance is two ancient, enormous stone doors taller than Tamlin's manor, which led into a vast chamber carved from pale rock upheld by carved pillars. The carvings depicted faeries and High Fae and animals in various environments and states of movement - stories of Prythian. Chandeliers of jewels hung between the pillars, staining the red marble floor with color. This led to the throne room. There were many other passageways and rooms within the mountain, including dungeon cells, luxurious bedroom suites, and the Middengard Wyrm's maze.

                Amarantha fashioned and modeled Under the Mountain after the famed Court of Nightmares, located in the treacherous northern Night Court, ruled by High Lord Rhysand and presided over by the Steward Keir, father of Mor. When under Amarantha's control, there was a dais that had two black stone thrones, one for her and one for Tamlin.
